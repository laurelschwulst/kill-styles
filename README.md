# Kill Styles

A simple tool to quickly show what any website(read as: most sites...) would look like with no CSS running. Drag this little bookmarklet up into your bookmarks bar.

Online at: [kill-styles.matt-wolff.com](https://kill-styles.matt-wolff.com)

Won't have an affect with styles generated by JS after the initial press. Could probably add an interval function to continue calling kill styles forever... Maybe later.

Other problems? ...Open an issue.

KILL â€™EM ALL

Notes:
- Based on [this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/jjb1yhb4/1/)
- Simplified and updated to Vanilla JS. Helps avoid any jQuery CORS issues.
