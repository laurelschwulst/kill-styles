# Kill Styles

A simple tool to quickly show what any website(read as: most sites...) would look like with no CSS running. Drag this little bookmarklet up into your bookmarks bar.

Won't have an affect with styles generated by JS after the initial press. Could probably add an interval function to continue calling kill styles forever... Maybe later.

Other problems... Open an issue.
